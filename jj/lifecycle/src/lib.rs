//! The `ci` topic lifecycle modelled by `jj/JjCi.tla`, as an executable
//! hierarchical state machine.
//!
//! The TLA+ model tracks the lifecycle as a set of flat variables. Here the
//! control facts become states and the data facts stay in shared storage:
//!
//! ```text
//! topic                         GatePasses, ParentLands; rejects the rest
//! ├── working                   Edit, TrunkAdvances, Abandon
//! │   ├── clean                 Rebase, Validate, Land, Finish
//! │   │   ├── editing
//! │   │   └── validated         Publish
//! │   └── conflicted            Edit keeps the conflict, Resolve
//! ├── delivered                 Finish
//! └── released { workspace, delivered }
//! ```
//!
//! `owner` and `active` hold exactly outside `released`, `conflict` is the
//! `conflicted` state, and `validated` is the `validated` state, whose head
//! is always the current one. `tests/spec.rs` checks every transition of the
//! bounded model against the TLA+ actions and every invariant against the
//! reachable states.
